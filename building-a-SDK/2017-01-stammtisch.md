#Building a SDK

[open source](http://developer.sensorberg.com/android/) at developer.sensorberg.com/android/
many learnings and good practices
all samples from actual problems
all code (used to be) live

---

#general thoughts

listen to your customers
new features tailored to individial customers
don¬¥t listen to customers, you are the expert
release early, release often (at least internally)

---


#think twice
#about everything

> sure let¬¥s move this class, wait, a customer is using it, all his code will not compile...


his imports are broken

---

#offer support

github issues
zendesk
gitter.im chat [^3]
telefone
workshops

**direct interaction might be the best**

#logging
![right](images/logcatgtfo.png)

ship a powerfull logging engine!
domain logging output
disable all log output by default
logging can be turned on

* log to file, send to developers...
* log to server

---

#testing

no fancy setup
recently switched to Espresso 2.0 with JUnit 4
add your own testrunner from the very start
test on devices

---

#testing - multidex

![](images/multidex.png)

our list of test dependencies

```
	androidTestCompile 'com.squareup:fest-android:1.0.8'
    androidTestCompile 'org.mockito:mockito-core:1.9.5'
    androidTestCompile 'com.google.dexmaker:dexmaker:1.0'
    androidTestCompile 'com.google.dexmaker:dexmaker-mockito:1.0'
    androidTestCompile ('com.android.support.test.espresso:espresso-core:2.0'){
        exclude group: 'com.squareup', module: 'javawriter'
    }
    androidTestCompile 'com.android.support.test:testing-support-lib:0.1'
    androidTestCompile 'org.apache.commons:commons-io:1.3.2'
    androidTestCompile('com.squareup.okhttp:mockwebserver:2.1.0') {
        exclude group: 'com.squareup.okhttp'
    }
    androidTestCompile 'org.apache.commons:commons-io:1.3.2'
```

we are having the multidex problem üò≥

---
#multidex test project

```
androidTestCompile ('com.android.support:multidex:1.0.0')
```

```
public class SensorbergTestRunner extends android.support.test.runner.AndroidJUnitRunner {

    @Override
    public void onCreate(Bundle arguments) {
        MultiDex.install(getTargetContext());
        super.onCreate(arguments);
```
* not all tests found and executed on Dalvik, but no crashes
* no problems with ART

#dogfooding

use services like hockeyapp/crashlytics
"release early, release often"
play alpha & beta
you want problems with your SDK/library happen to a colleague

---


#build an app

![](images/showcaseAndroid.png)

be your own customer

build your own sample apps

build lot¬¥s of samples

answer integration question with samples

"developer mode"

---

#build process
make sure you can release at the speed you wish, if neccesary every hour.

Bugs are okay, if you can fix them within hours and deploy them that fast, customers will be impressed.

#fatjar / fataar

fataar  = aar with all dependencies

not solved:

 * https://github.com/vRallev/jarjar-gradle

---

#releasing

jcenter ftw

your own public nexus

github pages

![right](images/githubRepo.png)

---

#github pages

check **uploadGithub.gradle** and **verifyTasks.gradle**

 * clone repo, deploy artifact, push to mvn-repo
 * be strict: don¬¥t remove releases, don¬¥t override releases

```
repositories {
    maven {
        url "https://raw.github.com/sensorberg-dev/android-sdk/mvn-repo";
    }
}
```

#jitpack.io

#architecture

* everything should be testable (if you need to)
* ~~mock sever requests~~
* ~~mock device callbacks~~
* ~~blocking threading for tests~~
* RxJava

---

#architecture cont.

##Dependency injection

do.it.

---

#Settings.java

have many internal settings
build an API for remote changing them

document them to individual customers/users
good for testing as well

auto-generate and auto-fill POJO from Json and merge from API response
make it simple/fast to add as many settings as needed

---

#feature flags

use the settings or other measures.
ship code early, activate later
test on production code

---


#secret codes

```
*#*#code#*#* in the dialer
```
* enable features at runtime
* no persistence!
* good for switching environments

#reviews

you are alone

you know nothing.

review your code

explain it to colleagues

invite somebody external

talk about in at a conference, meetup...

---

#dependencies

choose wisely

be forward compatible

be aware of updates, at least test with newer dependencies

update your SDK regularly to use the latest dependencies

---
#dependencies

![](images/jcenter.png)

"Name Mangling"
-> change the package of dependencies if necessary

1. clone
2. change package
3. push
4. release [^7]

#security?

![right](images/jdGui.png)

You ship a jar/aar with class files
JD-Gui -> java

> all your source are belong to every customer

Decide who you trust, it¬¥s really hard to hide from your host app

---

#security?

if you really want to be safe, pull all the strings

SSL pinning:

* customer can override the cert check

---


#obfuscation

proguard ftw

* we never choose to ship proguarded code
* usefull when stripping unused classes
	* ship an proguard rules file and let the customer decide

dexguard might be better (no experience)

harder troubleshooting

---

#proguard

check android-sdk/build.gradle
release a proguard file for your application

#minimise build types with environment parameters
```
project.ext {

    // System.getenv(<key>) comes from CI for Hockey build
    // other parameters write here to use on normal debug and release builds
    applicationId = System.getenv("APP_ID") as String ?: "com.sensorberg.beacfg"
    // we cannot use APP_NAME because gradle messes with it
    resAppName = System.getenv("RES_APP_NAME") as String ?: "BeaconConfig"
    versionCode = System.getenv("VERSION_CODE") as Integer ?: 2
    hockeyId = getHockeyKey()

    // to create a release, simply tag the commit. The tag will be used as version name e.g: `2.0.1`
    // create tag: git tag -a 2.0 -m "Initial V2 release"
    // push tag: git push origin --tags
    // delete tag: git tag -d 2.0
    // push tag deletion: git push origin :refs/tags/2.0
    versionName = System.getenv("BITRISE_GIT_TAG") as String ?: "2.x"
}
```
