#how do I do it

Fridays off **"If it´s urgent, call me even on a friday, I don´t want to clean up a mess every monday"**
Monday - Thursday everything is regular
**crunch times may interupt my schedule** I actually have one day buffer per week
I don´t believe in overtime, my productivity has a natural limit. **I have to pick up my daughter every wednesday at 4pm**

---

## Why did I do this?
#### #work-life-balance
## I love my job...

# outside reception

* **people are wishing me "happy weekend on thursday"**
my weekend is also Saturday & Sunday
* **"your alone-spa-day"**
I´ve always got stuff to do
This is why I need one day extra to things done

Imagine a freelance coworker who always has another client on Friday

You don´t treat him any special on a Thursday, right?

#final thoughts

* prolong contract? most likely
* 80% is a good compromise
* four 100% days a week works best for me.
* combine with flexi leave

---

#talking points

* tandemploy
* Elternzeitgesetz
* hiring is difficult, keeping employees as well
